# custom-select-dropdown-vanillajs
A custom select dropdown element that replace the built-in select. All the functionality is made in Vanilla JS for work as a library.
It's not the most useful project in the world but it has been fun mess around developing it because of how tricky some parts are in the behaviour of the select items.
